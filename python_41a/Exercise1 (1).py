Exercise 3.4 page 29:

Exercise 3.4. A function object is a value you can assign to a variable or pass as an argument. For
example, do_twice is a function that takes a function object as an argument and calls it twice:
def do_twice(f):
      f()
      f()
Hereâ€™s an example that uses do_twice to call a function named print_spam twice.
def print_spam():
       print 'spam'    
do_twice(print_spam)

"""

#1
def do_twice(f):
      f()
      f()

def print_spam():
       print ('spam')    
do_twice(print_spam)

# 2. Modify do_twice so that it takes two arguments, a function object and
# a value, and calls the function twice, passing the value as an argument.

def do_twice(f,value):
      f(value)
      f(value)

def print_string(string):
       print (string)
       
do_twice(print_string, 'hey')

# 3. Write a more general version of print_spam, called print_twice, that 
# takes a string as a parameter and prints it twice.

def print_twice(string):
      print(string)
      print(string)

#4. Use the modified version of do_twice to call print_twice twice, passing 'spam' as an argument.

do_twice(print_twice,"spam")

#5 Define a new function called do_four that takes a function object and a value and calls the
#function four times, passing the value as a parameter. There should be only two statements in
#the body of this function, not four.

def do_four(x,y):
      do_twice(x,y)
      do_twice(x,y)
